Vypa's solo attacks against her country's military dictatorship were so prolific the military assumed her work was the result of a small team of people. At one point, Vypa mistook a remote Guerrilla Warfare (GW) training ground for a government outpost. Shortly after invoking one of her infamous 'sting and choke' maneuvers on the camp she realized her mistake, but not before she had Capt. Crasswater tied up to a tree and threatened at knife point. Impressed and a little frightened, Crasswater recruited Vypa and her sisters into the GW. Together they now lead all jungle-based GW missions and 'government awareness' campaigns.",
